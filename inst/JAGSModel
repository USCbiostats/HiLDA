## File specifications

You can find four .txt files in inst/ folder as followed:
- global.txt
- global_tr.txt
- local.txt
- local_tr.txt

## Why we need those files?

Those files contain the JAGS model specification for running the global test and 
the local test in HiLDA with and without specifying the transcription strand 
direction. By using the R package R2jags, one of the model will be supplied to 
the function to run MCMC. 

## How we create those files?

The JAGS model is entered using a text editor and later used by R. The syntax
can be found here using the JAGS Version 4.3.0 user manual
