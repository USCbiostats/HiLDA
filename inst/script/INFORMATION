## esophageal.mp.txt.gz

### Introduction
This data was used in the following paper, which contains 146 samples obtained 
from the esopheageal cancer patients: Shiraishi et al. A simple model-based 
approach to inferring and visualizing cancer mutation signatures 
http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005657

### The data source
You can download the dataset from the GitHub repo here 
https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature_paper/tree/master/analysis/AlexandrovEtAl/result/MPFormat

### Instructions
Please use inst/script/use_esophageal.R to read in this data. 

## hildaLocal.rdata

### Introduction
By loading this file, you will access an rjags object that stores the local test 
on the sample G. 

### The data source
This data was generated from running the local test on the sample G. 

### Instructions
Please use inst/script/use_hildaLocal.R to read in this data. 


## sample.rdata

### Introduction
By loading this file, you will be able to access an object, sample G, of ten 
mutational catalogs. 

### The data source
The sample data was was simulated with two groups of mutational catalogs using 
three mutational (7, 13, 23) signatures from Shiraishi et al's paper mentioned 
above. The first group contains 4 samples with 150 mutations per sample, of 
which the proportions were drawn from a Dirichlet distribution of Dir(1, 2, 3). 
In the second group, 6 samples with 100 mutations per sample were simulated, of 
which the proportions were drawn from a Dirichlet distribution of Dir(3, 2, 1). 

### Instructions
Please use inst/script/use_sampledata.R to read in this data.
