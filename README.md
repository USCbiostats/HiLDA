# HiLDA: "*Hi*erarchical *L*atent *D*irichlet *A*llocation" 


## Introduction

The R package `HiLDA` is developed under the Bayesian framework to allow 
statistically testing whether there is a change in the mutation burdens of 
mutation signatures between two groups. The mutation signature is defined based 
on the independent model proposed by Shiraishi's et al.
